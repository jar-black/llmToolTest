# Two-Stage Test Prompts
# These prompts are designed to trigger sequential tool calls
# Stage 1: LLM lists directory contents
# Stage 2: LLM reads files from the directory

# Analyze all files in the config directory
Please analyze all the files in the ./config directory. First list what files are there, then read and summarize the content of each file.

# Examine Python files in current directory
Can you examine all Python files in the current directory? List them first, then read each one and tell me what they do.

# Review text files in config folder
I need you to review all .txt files in the config folder. Start by listing the directory, then read each text file.
